Create a menu that asks the user if he wants to eat something:
eg. 1. Would you like Pizza?
    2. Would you like a Burger? 
    3. Exit

If the user chooses 1 or 2 then output a statement like "you are eating a burger or pizza".

After the message is given to the user, show the menu again.

However if the user chooses 3 then exist the program.

If the user enters something other than 1,2, or 3, inform him he has made an error and to make an appropriate selection and show the menu again.

Test your output with different cases.
